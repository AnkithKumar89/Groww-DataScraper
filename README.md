# Groww Mutual Fund Manager Scraper

## Description:
This project is a web scraper that extracts information on mutual fund managers from the Groww website. Specifically, it retrieves the URLs for a list of companies and extracts the names and joining dates of their mutual fund managers. The scraped data is stored in an Excel file, along with graph data for each company.

The scraper is written in Python and uses the following libraries: `os`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `openpyxl`. It is designed to be easy to use and can be adapted to scrape other websites with similar structures.
